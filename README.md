# ImageHoster

This project is basically the assignment of the upgrad : Full Stack Software Development.

Other Details : 

In this segment, the task is to upload an image with its associating details.
The image must be stored in the database but currently, we are not storing the image details in the database.
The business logic is not implemented and returns void instead of storing the image in the database.
The ‘logged-in’ fragment is defined in the ‘layout.html’ file containing the option to upload an image and this fragment is used in ‘images.html’,
‘image.html’ and ‘upload.html’ files.
Also, note that after you upload the imageFile, it is encoded to Base64 format and stored as a string.
