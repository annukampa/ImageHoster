# ImageHoster

This project is basically the assignment of the upgrad : Full Stack Software Development.

Other Details : 

The To-Do tasks that were required to do are : 

###### Part A: Fixing Issues
1. Image upload issues : If you upload an image with the same exact title as of a previously uploaded image, it will get uploaded. But then, if you try to navigate to one of the images with the same title, the image uploader will display an error.
2. After logging into the application, it is possible to edit/delete the image which is posted by some other user. This is a bug in the application. Now, fix this bug in the application, such that only the owner of the image can edit/delete the image.

###### Part B: Implement a new feature
After fixing the above issues, please implement the following features into the image uploader application:

1.  Password Strength

Up till now, there is no check on the strength of the password entered by the user at the time of registration. Let us try to keep a check on the strength of the password entered by the user at the time of registration. You need to implement a feature wherein the password entered by the user must contain at least 1 alphabet (a-z or A-Z), 1 number (0-9) and 1 special character (any character other than a-z, A-Z and 0-9). The user must only be registered if the password contains 1 alphabet, 1 number, and 1 special character. And after successful registration, you must directly return 'users/login.html' file. Otherwise, the user must not be registered and again return the ‘users/registration.html’ file. You also need to display a message ‘Password must contain at least 1 alphabet, 1 number & 1 special character’.
